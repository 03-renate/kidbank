## Project Overview

The **BankKid** is a web-based financial management tool designed for teens aged 14–18. It helps them track their finances while enforcing age-appropriate restrictions on purchases (e.g., no alcohol, cigarettes, energy drinks, or explicit content). Key features include a balance tracker, transaction history, and a purchase system with built-in safeguards.

This project is part of a **team-base school assingment**, where the goal is to collaborate in an agile team enviroment, improving and updating the project over time rather than delivering a finalize product.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, to create a responsive and mobile-friendly interface.
